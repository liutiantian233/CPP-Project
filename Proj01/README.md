# Real and imaginary operations

## The Problem

You should all have learned something about complex numbers in your travels. A complex number actually consists of two parts: a **real part** and an **imaginary part**. The imaginary part is multiplied by the special value **i**, the √-1. A complex number is usually written in the form 1 + 2i , a sum with the real part first, the imaginary part second followed by i.

We are just going to do some basic math. You will read in two complex numbers and provide the sum, difference, product and quotient of those two values.

# Some Background

You forgot about complex numbers, didn't you. Well, Wikipedia is here to help. There's far more information here than you need, but the two most important sections are [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number#Addition_and_subtraction). You can get the formulas from there.

# Program Specifications

Your program will do the following:

1. Take as input four floating point values (in this order, as indicated):

   1. a real value and an imaginary value for the first complex number
   2. a real value and an imaginary value for the second complex number

2. Print the following four results: the sum, the difference, the product and the quotient of the 2 complex numbers. You will use **exactly** the following format:

   1. Each result on a single line (thus 4 lines printed)
   2. The precision is to two decimal point of accuracy (see note 1c below)
   3. output looks like the following **exactly**: 1 + 2i that is, a float, a space, a plus Deliverables sign, a space, a float followed directly by the letter i
