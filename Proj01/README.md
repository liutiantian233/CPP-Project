# Real and imaginary operations

## The Problem

You should all have learned something about complex numbers in your travels. A complex number actually consists of two parts: a **real part** and an **imaginary part**. The imaginary part is multiplied by the special value **i**, the âˆš-1. A complex number is usually written in the form 1 + 2i , a sum with the real part first, the imaginary part second followed by i.

We are just going to do some basic math. You will read in two complex numbers and provide the sum, difference, product and quotient of those two values.

# Some Background

You forgot about complex numbers, didn't you. Well, Wikipedia is here to help. There's far more information here than you need, but the two most important sections are [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number#Addition_and_subtraction). You can get the formulas from there.

# Program Specifications

Your program will do the following:

1. Take as input four floating point values (in this order, as indicated):
