# MVM List

## Assignment Overview

In the previous assignments you were introduced to a custom data structure, `MVM`, that did not use the potential STL bases (`map` and `set`) but used the `vector class` (Project 09) or a `dynamic array` (Project 10). In this project, you will once again re-write the `MVM` again as a templated class using a linked list.

## Background

You are going to re-create the `MVM` again using a `linked list` for the `MVM Element`. The `Element class` will again continue using a fixed-size array for `values_` as in Project 10, but `data_` in the `MVM class` will utilize a singly a `linked list`. The fixed-size of the array `values_` in `Element` means that only so many values can be associated with each key, but using a `linked list` we can accommodate a variable number of `Elements` in an `MVM`. Other than this one change, the basic properties of how the `MVM class` behaves remain the same. The implementation of the `MVM` will need to be updated to handle the substitution of a `linked list` for arrays.

As before, each `Element` has a `K key_`, a `V [element_array_size] values_`, a `size_t count_` to track the number of values currently being stored, and a new `Element* next_` to construct the `linked list`. The `MVM` has an `Element<K, V> * data_head_` which points to the first `Element` in the `linked list` as well as a `size_t num_keys_` to keep track of the number of active keys.

## About Singly-Linked Lists

A singly-linked list has only the ability to move in one direction, from a location in the list towards the end, basically forward through the list. You cannot move backwards through a singly-linked list. The slides from this week describe how we could implement a doubly-linked list to overcome this limitation, but we have enough to do with singly-linked lists.

The inability to move both forwards **and** backwards means that one of the fundamental approaches we used in Project 09 and Project 10 cannot be utilized, namely the use of `lower_bound`. In fact, most of the STL algorithms will not work for this very reason. We still require that a new `Element` should be placed in the list in its sorted location when added, but we must now revert to basic linear search to find that location. That is, to find where to put the new `Element` we need to start from the beginning of the list and iterate forward, one `Element` at a time, until we come to the insertion location.

## Details

`Element<K, V>`

Much of this remains the same, but we add a new data member `next_`. The data member `next_` will be a pointer to the next `Element` in the `linked list`. You can think of `Element` as taking the role of `Node` in the examples, where `Element` is a more complicated version of `Node`.

**Functions re-used from projects 09/10:**

`Element() = default`

- Default ctor. Do not need to write.

`Element(K key, initializer_list<V> values)`

- copy into the array `values_` and set `count_` correctly.
- Sets `next_` to `nullptr` (no next `Element` in a list yet).

`bool operator == (const Element&)`

- Behavior is identical to the previous project. Doesn't need to account for `next_`.

`friend ostream& operator << (ostream&, Element&)`

- Behavior is identical to the previous project.

`bool operator < (const K&)`

- Optional; compares the key passed to the element's key.

**New functions for project 11:**

`Element(const Element& other)`

- Copy ctor. Copies `count_` and `values_`. Sets `next_` to `nullptr`. Remember that `values_` is a fixed-size array. You know how to copy that, you just did it in project 10.

`MVM<K, V>`

**Functions re-used from projects 09/10:**

`MVM() = default`

- Default ctor. Do not need to write.

`MVM(initializer_list<Element<K, V>)`

- Behavior is identical to the previous project. However, you are now adding `Elements`, in order as found in the `initializer_list`, into a `linked list`. Same idea, different data structure.

`MVM(const MVM& other)`

- Copy ctor. Creates a copy of other. The ctor for Element can copy the Element, but you need to recreate the linked list yourself.

`~MVM()`

- Destructor. Deletes any allocated memory as necessary.

`pair<Element*, Element*> find_key(K key)`

- We can no longer use `lower_bound` as we mentioned.
- However, having a singly linked list means that finding only the first greater value is of limited use.
- Thus we change the return value to be an STL `pair` of pointers, the first of which points to the first `Element` whose `key_` is either equal to or just greater than the parameter key, and the second of which points to the `Element` just behind (just previous to) the first `Element`.
- This return behavior should help you to link/add and unlink/remove items from the linked list.
- If there is no smaller `Element`, return a `nullptr` for the first part of the pair. If there is no greater or equal `Element`, return a `nullptr` as the second part of the pair. If the list is empty, return a pair with both values being `nullptr`.

`MVM find_value(V value)`

- finds all keys where value is located.
- creates an `MVM` where each key is a key that has `value` in its `values_`, and the only value associated with each key is `value`.
- returns the new `MVM`.

`bool add(string key, string value)`

- Behavior is identical to previous project, with the exception being that you no longer need to call `grow()`, just dynamically allocate a new Element as necessary.

`size_t size()`

- Returns `num_keys_`.

`bool remove_key(K key)`

- Behavior is identical to previous project.

`MVM remove_value(V value);`

- finds all keys where `value` is located, and removes `value` from the `values_` array.
- creates and returns a `MVM` of the same format used in `find_value`.
- Hint: use the `find_value` function to handle most of the work.

`friend ostream& operator << (ostream&, MVM&)`

- Behavior is identical to previous project.

**New functions for project 11:**

`MVM& operator = (const MVM& other)`

- Makes this have the same values as other.
- Hint: use the copy ctor to make a copy of other that you can then use to swap data members with the local `MVM`.

# Assignment Notes

## Element operator==

You have to get this one right! Do it first. Nothing will work without it so check it. It isn't that hard. Be sure to take into account `num_elements_`, and `num_keys_`.

## no more lower_bound

As we are using a linked list to store the `MVM`, we can no longer use `lower_bound`. However, we still require the Elements to be stored in sorted order for consistency.

## add

The critical method is `add`. Get that right first and then much of the rest is easy. For example, the initializer list constructor can then use `add` to put `Elements` into the vector at the correct location (in sorted order)

## sort

No use of sort allowed and it wouldn't work anyway as mentioned. Use `find_key` to get an `Element` where it needs to be in the linked list.

## private vs public

You will note that all elements in the class are public. We do this to make testing easier. Any public part can be accessed in a main program which is convenient. The parts that should be private are marked. In particular the member variables `data_` and `num_keys_` and the member functions `find_value` and `find_key` should probably be private.

## initializer_list ctor

It should be the case that the Elements in the `initializer_list` ctor should insert into the `MVM` in key order using `add`. However, that again makes testing harder (can't set up a simple `MVM` without getting `add` to work, and it is the most work). Thus we allow you to write the `initializer_list` ctor to put Elements into the `MVM` in the order of the list `Elements`. We will guarantee for our testing that anytime we use the `initializer_list` ctor we will start out with `Elements` in key order. After that maintaining that order will be up to you.
