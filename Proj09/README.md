# MVM

## Assignment Overview

In this assignment you will practice creating a custom data structure, `MVM`, which extends the map class, without using the potential STL bases (map and set). You will create two classes to do this work.

## Background

You are going to create a container called a `Multi_Value_Map` but which we will shorten to just `MVM`. A `MVM` is a kind of associative container that has unique keys, like a regular map, but can have associated with each key a **group** of values, not just one value. That is, you store values that have a key: `{value_a, value_b, value_c, ...}` relationship. The `MVM` has the following restrictions:

- The key is unique. There is no repeat of a key in a `MVM`.
- The values associated with a **particular** key are also unique. A value cannot be repeated in association with a key. **However** a value can show up associated with **different** keys (can repeat across multiple keys) and that is allowed.
- The entries in a `MVM` are always sorted in key order. That is, if you add a new key to a `MVM`, it will be placed in its proper sorted position relative to the other keys. You do not need to use the sort function to do this, see details below.
- The values associated with a key are stored in first come, first serve order. That is, the first entry in a list of values associated with a key is the first value added, the second in the list the second value added.

You are going to build an `MVM` that stores keys as strings and values as string. No templating of your class yet. To support this work, we will also design another class called `Element`. You can think of `Element` as the payload class to be used by `MVM`. The organization will look something like the following:

Each `Element` has a `string key_` and a `vector<string> values_` (note the underlines trailing the data members). The `MVM` has a `vector<Element> data_` which is organized in key order. Note that the value `a` is repeated in multiple Element's `value_` vector but no value is repeated in the same `values_` vector. Neither is any `key_` repeated. The indicies of `data_` are shown for clarity and are not part of the actual data structure.

# Details

We provide a header file, which provides details of type for all the required methods and functions for the classes `Element` and `MVM`.

## `Element`

`Element() = default`

- Default. Do not need to write.

`Element(string key, initializer_list<string> values)`

- Take a string key and an initializer_list values and construct an `Element` with those values.

`bool operator == (const Element&)`

- Two `Elements` are equal if their two `keys_` are equal and if their two `values_` are equal.
  - return true if the two `Elements` meet this condition, false otherwise.
  - this is a member function.
  - Note: you do not have to compare each of the elements in `values_`, just compare the vectors directly.
- This will help with testing. You can see if two Elements are equal (what you think should be in the vector and what actually is). One liner, easy to write.

`friend ostream& operator << (ostream&, Element&)`

- output the `Element` to the provided ostream (do not just print to cout).

## `MVM`

`MVM() = default`

- Default. Do not need to write.

`MVM(initializer_list<Element>)`

- initialize the `data_` member to the `initializer_list`.
- is added in `initializer_list` order (see note below).

`vector<Element>::iterator find_key(string key);`

- must use the algorithm `std::lower_bound`.
- returns an iterator that points to an `Element` in `data_`.
- return value cases are:
  - points to an `Element` in `data_` which has the key.
  - point to an `Element` in `data_` which is just bigger than the key (thus the key is not there).
    - if `data_.end()`, the key is not there and it is bigger than all existing keys.

`vector<string> find_value(string val)`

- returns a (possibly empty) `vector<string>` which is a list of all keys where `val` is located.

`bool add(string key, string value)`

Should use `find_keys`. The cases are:

- The `key` exists. Check the `value`.
  - `value` not in `values_`, push it onto the back of `values_`.
  - `value` is already in `values_`, do nothing but return false.
- The `key` is not there and it is bigger than all existing keys.
  - push a new `Element(key, {value})` onto the back of `data_`.
- The `key` is not there. The `find_key` iterator can be used to do an `insert` into `data_`.
- The return is always true unless the key and the value (both) already exist.

`size_t size()`

- size of `data_`.

`bool remove_key(string key)`

- check if `key` is in the `MVM` (use `find_key`).
  - if yes, remove and return true.
  - if not do nothing and return false.

`vector<string> remove_value(string)`

- for every `Element` in the `MVM`.
  - if the `value` is in the `values_` of the `Element`, remove it.
  - return a `vector<string>` of all the keys where a value was removed.

`friend ostream& operator << (ostream&, MVM&)`

- print an `MVM`.

# Assignment Notes

## Element operator ==

You have to get this one right! Do it first. Nothing will work without it so check it. It is not that hard.

## lower_bound

Your new favorite algorithm should be `lower_bound`. Look it up. It returns an iterator to the **first** `Element` in a container that is **not less than** (that is, greater than or equal to) the provided search value. It requires that the container `Elements` be in **sorted order**, and if so does a fast search (a binary search) to find the search value. It has the following form:

`lower_bound(container.begin(), container.end(), value_to_search_for)`

or

`lower_bound(container.begin(), container.end(), value_to_search_for, binary_predicate)`

where the `binary_predicate` takes 2 arguments: the first an `Element` of the container and the second the `value_to_search_for`. It returns true if the `Element` of the container is less than `value_to_search_for`. Remember, less than of `Element` is by `key_`.

The return value is an iterator to the either the `Element` in the container that meets the criteria, or the value of the last `Element` in the range searched (in this case, `container.end()`)

That means that either:

- the `value_to_search_for` is already in the container and the iterator points to it.
- `value_to_search_for` is not in the container. Not in the container means:
  - the iterator points to a value **just greater** than the 	`value_to_search_for`.
  - the iterator points to `container.end()`.

## Why lower_bound instead of a loop?

Why not just use a loop to look for a key or value? Because on a sorted list `lower_bound` is very efficient. It does a binary search. If you are a Price-is-Right fan this is the search you should use in the Hi-Lo game. Look at the diagram below.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liutiantian233/CPP-Project/master/Proj09/Proj09-2.png)

if the elements are sorted, you can find the value quickly or discover it is not there. This is what `lower_bound` does on a sorted list for a search. We want to be efficient so we require that:

- when you add an `Element`, you put it in the location it would go if is sorted key order (no sorting).
- if already in sorted order, `lower_bound` is more efficient than a loop through every `Element`.

### vector insert

Very conveniently, you can do an insert on a vector. You must provide an iterator and a value to insert. The insert method places the new value **in front of** the iterator. In collaboration with `lower_bound`, you can place an `Element` in a vector at the location you wish, maintaining sorted order at every insert.

### add

The critical method is `add`. Get that right first and then much of the rest is easy. For example, the initializer list constructor can then use `add` to put `Elements` into the vector at the correct location (in sorted order).

### sort

No use of sort allowed. If you use sort in a test case you will get 0 for that test case. Do a combination of `lower_bound` and vector insert to get an `Element` where it needs to be in a vector.

### Empty strings

Since empty strings are used to indicate values not found, none of the valid keys or values stored in the `MVM` will be empty.

### private VS public

You will note that all elements in the class are public. We do this to make testing easier. Any public part can be accessed in a main program which is convenient. The parts that should be private are marked. In particular `data_` and the `find_value` and `find_key` members should probably be private.

### initializer_list ctor

It should be the case that the `Elements` in the `initializer_list` ctor should insert into the `MVM` in key order using `add`. However, that again makes testing harder (can not set up a simple `MVM` without getting `add` to work, and it is the most work). Thus we allow you to write the `initializer_list` ctor to put `Elements` into the `MVM` in the order of the list `Elements`. We will guarantee for our testing that anytime we use the `initializer_list` ctor we will start out with `Elements` in key order. After that maintaining that order will be up to you.
